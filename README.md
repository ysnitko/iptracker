## Overview

### How to start

Create a directory in which the project will be located.

Using a terminal launched from your development environment, go to the created directory and execute the command git clone https://github.com/ysnitko/iptracker.git.

Run the command in the terminal: cd iptracker.

To download the necessary libraries used in the project, run the command in the terminal npm i.
